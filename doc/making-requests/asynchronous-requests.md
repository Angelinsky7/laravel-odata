# Asynchronous requests

The OData specification defines [asynchronous requests](https://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.01/os/part1-protocol/odata-v4.01-os-part1-protocol.html#_Toc31359016)
where the client indicates that it prefers the server to respond asynchronously via the `respond-async` Prefer header. This is helpful
for long-running [operations](#operations).

Lodata handles this by generating a Laravel [job](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/queues#creating-jobs) which is then processed by
Laravel in the same way it handles any other queued job. For this to work your Laravel installation must have a working job queue.

When the client sends a request in this way, the server dispatches the job and returns to the client a monitoring URL. The client
can use this URL to retrieve the job output, or its status if not completed or failed.

The job runner will execute the OData request in the normal way, but will write the output to a Laravel [disk](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/filesystem#obtaining-disk-instances)
for it to be picked up later. The name of this disk is set in the `disk` option in `config/lodata.php`. In a multi-server environment
this should be some type of shared storage such as NFS or AWS S3. The storage does not need to be client-facing, when the job output
is retrieved it is streamed to the client by the Laravel application.

## Sending a request

When dispatching a request with `Prefer: respond-async`, Lodata will return a `202 Accepted` header, and a `Location`
header with a URL that can be used to monitor the progress of the request and retrieve the result.

<code-group>
<code-block title="Request">
```uri
GET http://localhost:8000/odata/People
Prefer: respond-async
```
</code-block>

<code-block title="Response">
```
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
location: http://localhost:8000/odata/_lodata/monitor/b6534e03-564b-4a74-abe6-a912483688e6
```
```json
{
    "error": {
        "code": "accepted",
        "message": "Accepted",
        "target": null,
        "details": [],
        "innererror": {}
    }
}
```
</code-block>
</code-group>

## Monitoring the request

The request can be monitored on the returned URL. If the job is not started or in progress the monitoring URL
will return `202 Accepted`. If it is complete then it will return the result. The HTTP response code of the monitoring
URL will be `200 OK`, to check the HTTP response code of the request itself check the `asyncresult` response header.

::: warning
The result of the request can only be retrieved once. After it is retrieved further requests to the monitoring URL
will return `404 Not Found`.

<code-group>
<code-block title="Request">
```uri
GET http://localhost:8000/odata/_lodata/monitor/b6534e03-564b-4a74-abe6-a912483688e6
```
</code-block>

<code-block title="Response">
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
odata-version: 4.01
asyncresult: 200
```
```json
{
  "@context": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/odata/$metadata#People",
  "value": [
    {
      "id": "michael-caine",
      "name": "Michael Caine"
    },
    {
      "id": "bob-hoskins",
      "name": "Bob Hoskins"
    }
  ]
}
```
</code-block>
</code-group>

## Cancelling the request

If the request is pending then it can be cancelled by sending a DELETE request to the monitoring URL:

<code-group>
<code-block title="Request">
```uri
DELETE http://localhost:8000/odata/_lodata/monitor/b6534e03-564b-4a74-abe6-a912483688e6
```
</code-block>

<code-block title="Response">
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
odata-version: 4.01
```
</code-block>
</code-group>
